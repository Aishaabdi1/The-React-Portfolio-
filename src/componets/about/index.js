                I am an aspiring full stack web developer looking to gain a software
                engineering apprenticeship. I have been enrolled in the University of
               Birmingham's full-stack development bootcamp.I have learnt front end
              and back end technologies through a dynamic full stack curriculum,
              including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js,
               React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, and more. 
				</p>

                I applied aspects of front and back end development in a recent project. I
               worked on a team of five to{" "}

					that helps property owners advertise their properties,
					manage their tenants and manage their real estate all

					experiences on the web.
